# TRPC (Transport-layer Remote Procedure Call)
TRPC is a simple and efficient protocol for performing remote procedure calls (RPC) over a transport layer such as TCP or UDP. This repository provides an implementation of TRPC in both client and server-side, allowing developers to easily build distributed systems that communicate with each other.

<br>

## Requirements
To use TRPC, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (version 10 or above)

<br>

## Getting started
To use TRPC, you need to follow the steps below:
<br>
<br>

## Clone the repository to your local machine.
<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/gerodrig/trpc-playground.git
```
Install the dependencies by running the following command in the root directory of the repository:
<br>

```
yarn install
```
<br>

Start the server by running the following command:
```
yarn dev
```
<br>


This will start the TRPC server on localhost:3001.
<br>

In a separate terminal window, start the client by running the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the TRPC client and connect it to the server.
<br>
<br>



## Conclusion
TRPC is a simple and efficient protocol for performing remote procedure calls over a transport layer. With this implementation of TRPC in both client and server-side, you can easily build distributed systems that communicate with each other. We hope you find this implementation useful and welcome your feedback and contributions!
